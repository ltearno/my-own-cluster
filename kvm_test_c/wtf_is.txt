What the fuck is:


The XSAVE?
	A save of the current state of the CPU?

The XCR?
	eXtended Control Register
	CR3/CR0
	CR0 proc mode
	CR3 physical address of table 1


Memory handling?
	Need base address before doing all this
	1 page for EPT identity map (?)
	3 pages TSS address => tast state segment => stack => not needed

Running
	struct_kvm_run seems to point to interpreted bytes
	

MMAP (memory map?)
	You need a SPAPR_TCE (virtual translation control entry) => KVM_CREATE_SPAPR_TCE
	Size of mmap wth KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE

RIP
	REgister Instruction Pointer
